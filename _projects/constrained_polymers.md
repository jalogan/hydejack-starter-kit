# Polymers and Coarse-Grained Proteins

{:toc}

The structural properties of folded proteins are key to understanding their biological function and evolutionary constraints. One of the fundamental descriptors of protein structure is the radius of gyration ($$R_g$$), which quantifies the spatial distribution of atomic mass around the proteinâ€™s center of mass. The $$R_g$$ of a protein is influenced by its sequence, secondary structure content, and global packing constraints. A long-standing question in protein physics is how various factors, such as stereochemical constraints and sequence properties, shape the $$R_g$$ of folded proteins.

### What is a protein

  <figcaption>Figure 1: Schematic of a chain of amino acids. Each subunit looks identical with an alpha-Carbon ($$C_{\alpha}$$) atom in the center. What gives each amino acid its flavor is the "R" group in yellow. These are called the side chain of the amino acid and they are different for each of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids. </figcaption>

A polymer is a chain of monomer units that can be as simple (a single sphere) or as complex (complex molecule, e.g., amino acid) as necessary. Some of the most important and ubiquitous types of polymers are proteins, seen in Fig. 1. In proteins the monomer units are amino acids and the interactions between the amino acids and their surroundings and other parts of the protein, along with the conditions in which they exist, e.g., in a cell, cause the polymer to collapse in a very specific way. This collapse is called protein folding and when a protein folds incorrectly, it can lead to disease and other problems for the organism that relies on it. X-ray Crystallography is often used to probe the folded structures of proteins, so the folded configuration is sometimes called the protein crystal structure.

While breakthroughs in machine learning have improved our ability to predict the X-ray crystal structures of proteins from their amino acid sequences and to design new protein sequences, modeling the physical process of protein folding remains a challenge. Experimental studies of protein folding have revealed intermediate kinetic traps, fold switching, mechanisms of misfolding and aggregation, allostery, and structural changes in response to mutations.

The radius of gyration $$R_g$$

$$
R^2_g(N) = \frac{1}{N} \sum\limits_{k=1}^N | \vec{r}_k - \vec{r}_{\mathrm{com}} |^2,
$$

where $$N$$ is the number of monomers, $$\vec{r}_k$$ is the position of a monomer, and $$\vec{r}_{\mathrm{com}}$$ is the center of mass of the polymer. has been used for decades to describe the shape and compactness of a polymer configuration. In general, it represents the distance from a rotational axis where the mass could be concentrated to have the same moment of inertia. In polymer physics it is not often thought of in this way, but rather as one of several ways to quantify the size of the polymer. Flory discovered that the radius of gyration $$R_g$$ of polymers follows a simple power-law scaling relation $$R_g \propto N^{\nu}$$, where $$\nu \leq 1$$ depends on the polymer and how compact the configuration is. A value of $$\nu = 1.0$$ would mean that the polymer is perfectly straight, like a rod, whereas $$\nu \approx 0.33 - 0.40$$ corresponds to a collapsed simple polymer or a randomly close-packed structure.

### What are the critical features of folded proteins?

#### Key constraints of folded proteins
Discuss the key constraints, such as, bond angles, bond dihedrals, side chains, etc. 
#### Key observables to check how protein-like the model is
Discuss the key observables we want to match, such as, core packing fraction, fraction core, scattering, etc.
