# Intro to tensors from a physics perspective
## Just what you need to know to begin understanding tensors

### What are the critical features of folded proteins?

#### Key constraints of folded proteins
Discuss the key constraints, such as, bond angles, bond dihedrals, side chains, etc. 
#### Key observables to check how protein-like the model is
Discuss the key observables we want to match, such as, core packing fraction, fraction core, scattering, etc. 

### Key results
